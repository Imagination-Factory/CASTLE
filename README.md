# CASTLE
Implementation of CASTLE (Continuously Anonymizing Data Streams) by Christian Becker, Technical University of Munich (TUM), Germany, 2019.

## General

This is an algorithm for anonymizing identifiers of individuals and can support different kinds of attributes. The algorithm is based on the CASTLE paper focusing on continuously anonymizing data streams with a cluster-based approach.
This implementation was done in iPhython notebooks.

The python file is provided herein as additional provision to allow for easy execution in case iPython is not installed or the algorithm should be used in other scripts.


## Reference for iPython und Jupyter Notebook usage

> Fernando Pérez, Brian E. Granger, IPython: A System for Interactive Scientific Computing, Computing in Science and Engineering, vol. 9, no. 3, pp. 21-29, May/June 2007, doi:10.1109/MCSE.2007.53. URL: https://ipython.org

For running the iPython notebook we recommend using Jupyter

or other IDE's supporting these, such as Visual Studio (Code).


## Purpose of this Publication

For scientific publications the first version of the implementatoin of the CASTLE algorithm has been made public.


This code base is not maintained any more.
